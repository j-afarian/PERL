# PERL Projects
![Unimpressed Bitmoji](https://s13.postimg.org/p6f6edrpj/gitimage.png)  
This repo contains a collection of perl projects I have worked on as part of my university subjects & just general practice. There are also some notes and code snippets from weekly tutorials as well. Feel free to comment and give me tips, corrections, or suggestion if you feel like it.

## Tutorial Questions
**[What day is it?](https://github.com/j-afarian/PERL/blob/master/Tutorials/DayOfTheWeek.pl)**  
The first Monday of the month is randomly generated between 1 & 7 (inclusive). The user inputs any date number between 1 and 31 and the day of the week is output (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday).

## Weekly Snippets
**[Week Two](https://github.com/j-afarian/PERL/blob/master/Weekly%20Snippets/Week2Snippets.pl)**  
Arrays, lists, and hashes.  
  
**[Week Three](https://github.com/j-afarian/PERL/blob/master/Weekly%20Snippets/Week3Snippets.pl)**  
File handling, subroutines, and special variables.  

## Weekly Labs  
**[Week Three](https://github.com/j-afarian/PERL/tree/master/Labs/Week%203)**  
[Q1](https://github.com/j-afarian/PERL/blob/master/Labs/Week%203/q1.pl): Script to determine if there are any duplicate values in an array.  
[Q2](https://github.com/j-afarian/PERL/blob/master/Labs/Week%203/q2.pl): Script to return the first non-repeating character in a string.
