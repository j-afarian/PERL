COSC2468 Scripting Language Programming
Python (Assignment 2)

Notes:
The linux environment used to write this program uses Python 3.5 as default. In order to overcome some limitations faced with the 'run' feature, I required Python 3.6.

I was unable to replace Python 3.5 with 3.6 and had to install them alongside each other. As a result, my programs specifically call Python 3.6, as shown below:

#!/usr/bin/env python3.6

This may need to be changed to python3 if the marking environment uses an appropriate version of Python by default.
