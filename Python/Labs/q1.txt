Log into a Unix computer and use pydoc command to answer the following questions.

- What does os.listdir do?
Returns a list containing the names of the entries in the directory.
The list is in arbitrary order.

- What argments does it accept and what does it return?
It accepts a path as an arguement and returns a list of strings.

- Find the name of a string method which capitalises the first letter of every word in a string.
.title()

- Find functions that perform random number generation. How could you use this to generate a random string?
Must import random module: import random
random() generates a number between 0 and  (0, 0.1, 1 etc).
randint(1, 100) random number between 1-100.

Along with the string module (import string) we can generate random strings by using the following:
random = ''.join([random.choice(string.ascii_letters) for n in xrange(32)])
print random
